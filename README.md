**PLEASE dont use this. This is one of my old and really bad bots. I have no idea why i still kept it up.**

A (unofficial) Discord bot made with numbers in mind. Allows you to have a countning channel, where your server's member can count up, and a guess the number channel, where you can make timed (or not) events where your members have to guess a specific number.

Installing is like any other bot, if you dont know how to clone a bot off github go to another repo with an actually good bot to get a tutorial
