# NumberBot

A (unofficial) Discord bot made with numbers in mind. Allows you to have a countning channel, where your server's member can count up, and a guess the number channel, where you can make timed (or not) events where your members have to guess a specific number.
The bot is made in JavaScript using node.js and discord.js. Turning it on should be a simple `npm install` and adding the token in the config.json file.
